> “I am not now, nor have I ever been, part of any kind of antifascist or anti-racist organization – I just haven’t. I’m a professor,” Bray said on Monday about the circumstances. Noting that antifa is a decentralized movement, he added: “I’m a professor of the history of the left.” (via [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/07/rutgers-professor-turning-point-usa))

Very concerning news emerging from the USA, where academics are increasingly targets of political attacks and ostricisation. This is part of a much longer campaign from the organisation which is notorious for its [Professor Watchlist](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/sep/17/turning-point-usa-professor-watchlist), which encourages students to report on left-wing professors at US institutions.
