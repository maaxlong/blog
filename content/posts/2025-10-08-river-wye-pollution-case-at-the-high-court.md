> We see this legal claim as the culmination of an extraordinary effort by local community members and campaign groups to research, monitor and advocate for their rivers. The claimants have watched their rivers become the subject of national press coverage, public campaigns, Parliamentary debates and government pledges.  Formally commencing this legal action is a concrete step towards protecting these vital national ecosystems.

Lots of press coverage for this today, which is set to be [biggest environmental lawsuit](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crrj4qqqy7po) in the UK to date. Almost 4,000 locals have joined the legal claim against Avara Foods, Freemans of Newent, and Welsh Water, for "extensive and widespread pollution" in the rivers Wye, Lugg and their tributaries. The River Wye is going to be one of the case studies in my upcoming book project on the history of river pollution in Britain. 

There's so much discussion in the media about river pollution right now, but the historical context has been largely lacking. There are some interesting historical precedents to this case, including the 1952 'Pride of Derby' case pursued by the Anglers' Cooperative Association against British Celanese, Midland Tar Distillers, the Derby Corporation, and the British Electricity Authority for polluting the River Derwent, resulting in an injunction against all four defendants.
