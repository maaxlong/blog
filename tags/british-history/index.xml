The book, entitled Democratising History: Modern British History Inside and Out, is edited by Freddy Foks, Laura Carter, and Philip Harling. The introduction, by Laura and Freddy, is a particularly rich contribution to the field, outlining a rough genealogy for the concept of ‘democratisation’, which has so far received surprisingly little detailed attention by historians of Britain. The book is &lt;a href="https://uolpress.co.uk/book/democratising-history/"&gt;available to download&lt;/a&gt; for free now!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
