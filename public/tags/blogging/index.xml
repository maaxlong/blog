      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the content of my first post. The hugo-simple theme provides a clean, readable design perfect for text-focused content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean typography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark mode support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast loading (no JavaScript)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SEO friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write naturally in Markdown and the theme handles the rest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend we celebrated the career of Prof. Peter Mandler with a book launch and a conference featuring contributions from friends and colleagues across his career. The book, entitled Democratising History: Modern British History Inside and Out, is edited by Freddy Foks, Laura Carter, and Philip Harling. The introduction, by Laura and Freddy, is a particularly rich contribution to the field, outlining a rough genealogy for the concept of ‘democratisation’, which has so far received surprisingly little detailed attention by historians of Britain. The book is &lt;a href=&#34;https://uolpress.co.uk/book/democratising-history/&#34;&gt;available to download&lt;/a&gt; for free now!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
